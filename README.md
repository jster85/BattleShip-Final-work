# BattleShip-Final-work

Greetings! My name is Jonas. I am beginner coder
This is my first Git with my first coding project, which I created during my Java course in VilniusCodingSchool
Note: the project is not yet finished!
This project is my final work in the Java courses
It is fun and used to be popular classic game called "Battleships", where two players place their ships on 10 x 10 grid and engage in battle with the goal to destroy all opponent's ships. The first is winner
Game interface is in lithuanian language
You can create and join a game using a webserver, which lets you play it with your friend or a bot (not yet created)
The code includes 2 packages with 5 Java classes in each package (one pack for gameServices, one for gameElements)
Program uses Maven - a Java library management tool which helps to establish connection with web services
Current code version lets you place ships on board, establish connection with a webservice and make first shot
